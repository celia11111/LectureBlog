Chopin is a composer and virtuoso pianist who wrote primarily for solo piano. He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose "poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.

Frédéric Chopin’s Prelude in E Minor is another sad piano piece. The page-long composition is sure to leave you feeling depressed.

The opening melody is haunting and beautiful, but it also has a deep sense of sadness. This feeling only gets stronger as the piece progresses, with the addition of some very dark and depressing chord progressions around the simple melody.

The end of the piece is particularly sad, as the melody seems to just fade away into nothingness. This could be seen as a representation of hope fading away, which is a very depressing thought.

You can imagine Chopin writing this piece in the midst of his health issues from tuberculosis, which eventually led to his death at the young age of 39.
